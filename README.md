# API Documentation Update

## Issue
Encountered problems with the Backend Server while using the POST method for `/shifts/{id}/cancel` and `/shifts/{id}/book` endpoints. Despite spending considerable time debugging and testing using Postman, the POST method did not seem to be functioning as expected.

## Temporary Solution
Changed the problematic POST methods to GET:
- `/shifts/{id}/cancel` now uses `GET`
- `/shifts/{id}/book` now uses `GET`

This temporary fix allows continued frontend development, prioritizing immediate progress.
